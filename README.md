# Hemlock Fitness and Training Center

Updates to come.

## Description

This application serves as the homepage for the fictional Hemlock Fitness and Training Center - a long-standing Pennsylvania fitness facility that borrows its name from the state tree, the [Eastern Hemlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsuga_canadensis). Its primary aim is to offer insight for prospective customers into its staff, location, and facilities. As an established business in a highly competitive market it is vital to ensure that the business remains visible and accessible for both existing and prospective customers.

As a class project this assignment served as a chance to exercise our newly learned back-end development skills with Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming, Express.js, MySQL, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), and the Model-View-Controller paradigm in tandem with our previously learned front-end skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API technologies. This exercise occurred in a collaborative group environment where each member had to handle different aspects of a complex project in order to put together a complete, functional end product by a set deadline.
